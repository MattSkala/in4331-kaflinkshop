# Stress testing

## Results

- 1200 RPS max on a local machine - 8 cpu -> 4 jobs + 4 locust clients

## Problems
There are numerous problems with testing on a local machine. The bottlenecks from both the testing client as well as the system under test will together attribute to the overall results.

## ToDo

- More distributed testing
- Finding the worst bottlenecks
